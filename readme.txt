Developed by [The Uprising Creative](http://theuprisingcreative.com)
 
This plugin is open-source and we offer limited support.  If you do have an issue or question, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/topspin/topspin-wordpress/issues) and we'll work to help you out when time allows.
 
*PLEASE NOTE: This plugin is meant to be customized! It will work "out of the box" with just about any theme, but it may not match your site or be as "pretty" as you'd like.  Additionally, if your theme uses featured images in the header of posts, you may have to make adjustments to ensure the display of the products is to your liking.*

This plugin allows novice and pro Topspin users alike to quickly and easily create integrated, customized, sortable and dynamically generated stores from their Topspin Offers in a few minutes.

The plugin allows for the creation of any number of individual Store Pages and configurations of Topspin Offers based on Offer Types and Tags. Store Pages can be restricted to specific Offer Type(s) and/or Tag(s) and can then be sorted by Offer Type(s), Tag(s), or Manually using a new drag-and-drop admin interface. 

This new version of the plugin has been recoded from scratch to offer better performance and scalability, better integration with Wordpress post types, allows for better deep linking to individual products, support for multiple artists and Wordpress Multi Site, and much more. 

Although these pages are called Store Pages, they aren't restricted to just the Buy Button Offer Type.  You can create dynamic pages featuring Buy Buttons, Email For Media Widgets, Streaming Player Widgets, Single Track Player Widgets, and any combination of them. 

(For example, a Store Page can be created that lists all Buy Buttons.  A second Store Page can be created that lists Streaming Players, or some manually sorted combination of Email-For-Media Widgets, Streaming Players, and Buy Buttons.  A third Store Page can be created that lists only Buy Buttons with the Apparel tag, effectively creating an Apparel sub-category for the main store.  Since Tags are custom and manually created, you can group your products in an way that works for your individual needs, such as Featured Items, On-Sale Items, etc.)

In addition to automatically creating Store Pages, Shortcodes are also generated for each Store Page that allow it's contents to be embedded on any other Page or Post.  Shortcodes are also generated for individual offers, allowing any offer to be embedded in any post on your site. 

The possibilities are endless. 

(This new version of the Official Topspin Wordpress Plugin is a complete rebuild from the ground up, simplified and optimized to make launching an integrated Topspin Wordpress store in minutes. *This plugin is in active development and more features will be added regularly.  If you have a feature request or find a bug, please report it! Please see the Roadmap for more information.*)
